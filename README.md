# TMDB Movies Dataset Analysis
This analysis is about TMDB movies. The dataset was gotten from kaggle, we have conducted some analysis and posed some questions from the dataset. I'm a big fan of movies, that's the big reason why I decided to use TMDB dataset to analyze some of my favourite movies and see how they performed. Some of the questions include:
* What are the most expensive movies?
* Which movies have the highest profit?
* What year generated the highest profit?
